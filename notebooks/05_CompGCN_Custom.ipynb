    "# Task 5: CompGCN with Custom Node Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Implement a CompGCN (Composition-based Multi-Relational GCN) model for link prediction\n",
    "that leverages the **custom node attributes** (Gender, Generation, PageRank, Degrees, Community ID) derived in Tasks 1 & 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why CompGCN?\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard KGE models (TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE) learn entity embeddings **from scratch**\n",
    "using only the graph structure (triples). They ignore rich node-level features that we carefully\n",
    "computed in Tasks 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CompGCN** (Vashishth et al., 2020) is a GNN-based model that:\n",
    "1. Uses **composition functions** to jointly embed entities and relations\n",
    "2. Performs **relation-aware message passing** (forward + backward + self-loop)\n",
    "3. Can accept **custom initial features** instead of random embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Node Features (~58-dim)  →  Linear Projection (64-dim)  →  CompGCN Layers  →  RotatE Decoder\n",
    "  [Gender, Gen, PR,          [Learnable W·x + b]           [Message Passing]    [Score Triples]\n",
    "   Deg, Community(1-hot)]                                    × 2 layers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Dimension Mismatch\" Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Raw node features have ~58 dimensions (8 base + ~50 community one-hot),\n",
    "but GNN layers need a fixed hidden dimension (e.g., 64) for effective message passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Insert a **learnable projection layer** between the raw features and the GNN:\n",
    "- `Linear(input_dim, 64)` projects features to GNN's working dimension\n",
    "- `ReLU` activation adds non-linearity\n",
    "- Projection weights are **jointly trained** with CompGCN layers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Leakage Prevention for Community Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Community IDs must be computed **exclusively from the training graph** (train.txt).\n",
    "If we used the test graph's edges, communities would encode test-time connectivity\n",
    "patterns, leaking future information into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **PageRank/Degree** capture structural importance patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "> *CompGCN with custom features (especially Generation, Gender, and Community) should converge*>   are more likely to share relations (siblings, parent-child within the same clan)\n",
    "\n",
    "> *faster and achieve higher Hits@10 than standard RotatE with random initialization, because:*> - **Community ID** encodes family cluster membership — entities in the same community\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Gender** directly constrains gender-specific relations (fatherOf vs motherOf)> - **Generation** constrains generational relationships (parent-child = 1 gen apart)"

    "## 8. Analysis & Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectural Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**CompGCN-Custom** combines three innovations over standard KGE models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature-informed initialization:** Instead of random embeddings, entities start with\n",
    "   semantically meaningful features (gender, generation, community, etc.). This gives the model a\n",
    "   *warm start* — it doesn't need to discover these patterns from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structure-aware representations:** CompGCN's message passing enriches entity embeddings\n",
    "   by aggregating information from graph neighborhoods, using relation-specific compositions.\n",
    "   This captures higher-order structural patterns that static embeddings miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RotatE decoder:** The rotation-in-complex-space scoring function naturally handles\n",
    "   both symmetric and asymmetric relations — critical for family graphs where\n",
    "   fatherOf(A,B) ≠ fatherOf(B,A).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Utility Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Family knowledge graphs are uniquely suited for feature-enhanced models because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gender** is a hard constraint: `motherOf` → head must be Female, `fatherOf` → head must be Male.\n",
    "  This eliminates half the entity space for gender-specific relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generation** imposes ordering: parents are exactly 1 generation above children,\n",
    "  grandparents are 2 generations above. This drastically reduces valid entity candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Community ID** encodes family cluster membership. Entities within the same Louvain\n",
    "  community (detected in Task 2) belong to the same tightly connected family cluster.\n",
    "  This provides a strong prior: link prediction candidates within the same community\n",
    "  are far more likely than cross-community candidates. The one-hot encoding ensures\n",
    "  each community is treated as an independent categorical feature (no false ordinal bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PageRank/Degree** captures structural roles: patriarchs/matriarchs (high centrality)\n",
    "  are more likely to be connected to many descendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Leakage Prevention\n",
    "\n",
    "All features — including community IDs — are derived from the **training graph only**.\n",
    "The Louvain algorithm runs on `G_directed` (built from `train.txt`), which contains\n",
    "no edges from `test.txt`. This ensures the model cannot learn shortcuts from test-time\n",
    "graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Task 4 Models\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Type | Features Used | MRR |\n",
    "|-------|------|---------------|-----|\n",
    "| CompGCN-Custom | GNN + Features | Gender, Gen, PR, Deg, Community | (see above) |\n",

    "| Custom RGCN+DistMult (Task 4) | GNN | None (random) | ~0.62 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment demonstrates whether **domain-specific node attributes** can provide\n",
    "meaningful inductive bias for link prediction in structured (family) knowledge graphs,\n",
    "compared to purely structure-based learning."

    "## 9. CompGCN-Hybrid: Fixing Shortcut Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Pure Feature Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "The CompGCN-Custom model above suffers from **two critical issues**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identical Twin Problem:** Nodes sharing identical attributes (same gender, generation, community) produce **mathematically identical** initial representations. After CompGCN message-passing, structurally similar neighbors (e.g., two brothers) remain nearly indistinguishable, crushing **Hits@1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shortcut Learning:** The `community_id` one-hot feature is an **overpowered signal** — it instantly narrows entity candidates from 1,300 to ~26 family members. The model memorizes community clusters (loss → 0 within a few epochs) and never learns the fine-grained structural rules (father vs. son, uncle vs. nephew) needed for precise ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Hybrid-Residual Architecture (Dual-Stream Input)\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a **two-stream fusion** that combines the best of both worlds:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Stream | Input | Dimension | Purpose |\n",
    "|--------|-------|-----------|---------|\n",
    "| **A: Logic Stream** | Fixed features $\\mathbf{x}_v$ | 32 | Encode domain knowledge (gender, generation, community) |\n",
    "| **B: Identity Stream** | Learnable embedding $\\mathbf{e}_v$ | 32 | Provide unique per-node identity (break the twin problem) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fusion:** $\\mathbf{h}_v^{(0)} = [\\text{Logic}_v \\| \\text{Identity}_v] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{64}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Regularization: Feature Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent shortcut learning, we apply **Dropout(p=0.4)** to the feature tensor *before* projection:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}_{\\text{logic}} = \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{W} \\cdot \\text{Dropout}_{0.4}(\\mathbf{x}_v) + \\mathbf{b})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, ~40% of feature values are zeroed out each forward pass. This forces the model to:\n",
    "- Not rely solely on `community_id` (it's sometimes missing)\n",
    "- Learn robust representations from **combinations** of features\n",
    "- Allow the Identity Stream to contribute meaningful signal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | CompGCN-Custom (Old) | CompGCN-Hybrid (New) |\n",
    "|--------|---------------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| Loss curve | Crashes to 0 in ~5 epochs | Gradual decrease over 50–100 epochs |\n",
    "| Hits@1 | Low (twins indistinguishable) | Higher (identity stream breaks ties) |\n",
    "| Hits@10 | High (community narrows search) | Similar or higher |\n",
    "| Generalization | Overfits to community structure | Balances features + identity |"

    "## 10. Analysis: CompGCN-Hybrid vs Pure Features vs Standard RotatE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dual-Stream Architecture Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The CompGCN-Hybrid model addresses two fundamental failures of the pure-feature CompGCN:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |\n",
    "|-------|-----------|-----|\n",
    "| **Twin Problem** | Nodes with identical (Gender, Gen, Community) get identical embeddings | **Identity Stream**: 32-dim learnable embedding gives every node a unique vector |\n",
    "| **Shortcut Learning** | Community ID is too powerful → loss crashes to 0 in ~5 epochs | **Feature Dropout (p=0.4)**: Randomly masks ~40% of features each forward pass |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Feature Dropout Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Without dropout, the community one-hot encoding acts as a \"cheat code\":\n",
    "- It instantly narrows candidates from ~1,300 → ~26 entities (same family)\n",
    "- The model memorizes this shortcut and stops learning finer patterns\n",
    "- Result: perfect community-level discrimination but poor within-family ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "With dropout (p=0.4), community features are **randomly unavailable** during training:\n",
    "- The model must learn to rank entities using **combinations** of features\n",
    "- The identity stream provides fallback signal when features are dropped\n",
    "- Result: more robust representations that generalize better\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Loss Diagnostic\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the loss curve plot above:\n",
    "- **CompGCN-Custom (blue)**: If loss crashes to ~0 quickly → **shortcut learning confirmed**\n",
    "- **Standard RotatE (red)**: Gradual decrease over many epochs (healthy learning)\n",
    "- **CompGCN-Hybrid (green)**: Should show a **\"Goldilocks\" curve** — not as fast as Custom (no shortcuts), not as slow as pure RotatE (features still provide useful inductive bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Metrics to Watch\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hits@1** is the critical metric: it requires distinguishing the *exact* correct entity from all others. The identity stream should directly improve this by breaking feature-based ties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **MRR** captures overall ranking quality. The hybrid model should improve over pure features but may or may not match standard RotatE (which has maximum identity expressivity but no domain knowledge).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hits@10** measures broad recall. All three models should perform similarly here since even coarse community-level features suffice for top-10 ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectural Insight: The Feature-Identity Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "The three models represent points on a continuum:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pure Features (CompGCN-Custom)  ←——→  Hybrid (Features + ID)  ←——→  Pure Identity (Std RotatE)\n",
    "     All domain knowledge                  Balanced                    All learnable\n",
    "     No uniqueness                         Best of both                No domain knowledge\n",
    "     Shortcut learning risk                Regularized                 Slower convergence\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The hybrid occupies the \"sweet spot\" where domain features provide inductive bias (faster convergence, better generalization) while identity embeddings provide unique discrimination (better Hits@1)."
